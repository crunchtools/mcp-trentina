"""Architectural contract: there is ONE defense pipeline, and it lives in defense.py.

The L1 -> L2 -> L3 sequence was hand-rolled in eight places before the
extraction. Nobody set out to write eight; each was added by someone reasonable
who needed the layers and wrote the obvious four lines. That is how it happens,
and it is why "we'll keep it unified" is not a plan.

So this test enforces it. Any module that reaches past `defend()` to call a
detector directly is starting copy nine, and CI says so.

The rule is deliberately about the DETECTORS, not about every name in those
packages. Three categories are allowed through, each for a stated reason:

* Status probes (`is_classifier_available`, `classifier_status`) — these report
  whether a layer is loaded. /health and the stats tool need them and they
  cannot begin a pipeline.
* Types (`ClassifierResult`) — annotations, no behaviour.
* `quarantine_redact` — redact mode's turns 2 and 3 (extract, verify), which
  run AFTER defend() has detected. They are the mode's delivery, not a second
  detection path; tools reach them only through tools/judged.py.

If you are here because this test failed: you probably want `defend()`,
`defend_json()`, or `tools.judged.judge_and_deliver()`.
