"""Layer 2 integration tests — real payloads against a real model (#350).

Runs against whichever model ``CLASSIFIER_MODEL`` / ``CLASSIFIER_MODEL_PATH``
selects. CI runs this file once per model the image ships, inside the image.
Locally the tests skip when no model is installed, except under
``TRENTINA_REQUIRE_L2_MODEL=1``, where a model that fails to load fails the
run: until 0.55.0 CI pointed at a path the image never had and every test
here skipped, so the expectations drifted from both models unnoticed.

Each attack lists the models measured to flag it at their own threshold,
scored 2026-10-03 (Prompt Guard 2 86M at 0.5, prompt-injection-guard-small
at 0.7). A model with no expectations recorded still runs the benign checks.
