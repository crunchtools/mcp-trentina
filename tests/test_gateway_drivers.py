"""The one driver registry: parity with config, the channel lock, the kind lock.

There is one driver role and one table, in `gateway/drivers.py`. Until #167
there were two registries, each with its own parity test and only one of them
with a channel lock — which is how the text-processor table ended up with no
lock at all: it was written once, in the half nobody copied it out of. One
mechanism now, so this file covers everything with the same tests.

Four properties earn the file:

REGISTRY/LITERAL PARITY. The table is declared twice — once as a dict, once as
a `Literal` in `profile.py` that makes pydantic reject an unknown name at YAML
load. A driver in the table but not the Literal exists, is wired in, passes
its own tests, and can be named by no profile. It is dead on arrival and
nothing else fails to say so.

THE CHANNEL LOCK. A processor declares the ingresses it understands, and
selecting one elsewhere fails at config load rather than at 3am. The failure
it prevents is silent either way: a Matrix processor pointed at alert-ingress
JSON finds no Matrix event shape and falls through to generic rules on a
payload nobody checked it against; a text reducer pointed at the wrong shape
declines forever and looks like it is working.

THE KIND LOCK. A channel hands its processors a string or a parsed document,
never both. Without this the mismatch is an AttributeError deep in a request.

IT FIRES AT STARTUP. `loader._check_drivers` builds every driver a profile
names and throws the result away. Without that call the refusal moves to
whenever traffic first hits the path, which is a latent outage rather than a
lock.
