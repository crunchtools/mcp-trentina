"""The mandate: L1, L2 and L3 run on every input the gateway scans.

This file exists because the property is easy to lose by accident. It was
lost once already — not by anyone deciding to skip L3, but by a cost-control
threshold that looked like configuration and behaved like an off switch. A
gate that only fires on suspicious content is invisible in every test written
with suspicious content, which is most of them.

So these tests are deliberately boring. They feed the pipeline the most
innocuous input imaginable and assert the judge was called anyway. The day
someone adds a "cheap path" for clean traffic, this file is what says no.

The one thing that may stop L3 is L3 being unable to run. That is a degraded
state, and it must be visible as one rather than silently reading as clean.
