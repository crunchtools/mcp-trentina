"""Integrity tests for the Layer 3 adversarial corpus.

These tests make NO API calls. They prove two things about
``tests/adversarial_corpus.py``:

1. The corpus is well-formed (unique ids, valid risk levels, coherent
   attack/benign split).
2. Each case reaches the layer it claims to. Semantic attacks must survive
   Layer 1 (deterministic sanitization) untouched — otherwise they would never
   reach the Q-Agent and the provider benchmark would be measuring nothing.
   Structural attacks and the quoted-attack trap must be stripped by Layer 1,
   as annotated.

The Layer 2 assertions run only when the Prompt Guard model is available
(it lives at ``/models`` in the deployed container, not in local/CI checkouts).

If Layer 1 or Layer 2 ever changes such that a case's annotation no longer
holds, the corresponding test fails loudly — which is the signal to re-annotate
the case (e.g. move a now-caught attack down a layer), not to paper over it.

    """Reduction must not delete the thing the perimeter exists to catch.

    This replaces an ARGUMENT with a MEASUREMENT, and that is the whole point
    of the file.

    Until 0.22.0, `preprocess/petit.py` pinned `driver="RawEntry"` and passed
    its own stopword list, under a rule stated as "normalize only tokens that
    cannot carry meaning to a model — never words". The rule was never a test.
    It lived as prose in a docstring, and the docstring's own justification did
    not hold: it argued that keeping a payload distinct meant it "reaches the
    perimeter scan", while the next paragraph established that a payload which
    collides into a group is DELETED — and a deleted line reaches nobody, the
    scanner included.

    So the rule was not preventing smuggling. What it prevented was an attack
    being quietly dropped before anyone judged or recorded it. That is worth
    keeping, and it is measurable, which prose is not.

    Each case is buried in three carriers that look like real tool output —
    repetitive syslog, a JSON array of near-identical records, a quoted mail
    thread — and run through the production chain. The assertion is that the
    payload is still there afterwards.

    A case that legitimately does not survive becomes
    `survives_preprocessing=False` with a reason in `notes`. That is a visible
    edit to the corpus, not a skip, because "we measured this and accepted it"
    and "nobody noticed" must not look the same.
