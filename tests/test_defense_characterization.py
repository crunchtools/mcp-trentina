"""Characterization tests: what the five hand-rolled defense pipelines do TODAY.

Written before extracting `gateway/defense.py` so that "the refactor is
behaviour-neutral" is a thing we can demonstrate per call site rather than
assert. Every test here passes against the pre-extraction code.

Two kinds of test live in this file, and the difference matters:

1. Tests that pin behaviour we intend to KEEP. If one of these fails after the
   extraction, the refactor broke something.

2. Tests that pin behaviour we intend to CHANGE — the divergences between the
   five copies (`block_content` hardcoding untrusted, `alert_ingress` ignoring
   `profile.defense`, L3 gated on an API key rather than a threshold). These
   are marked DIVERGENCE. They are here so the change is deliberate: the test
   fails, someone reads why, and updates it on purpose. That is the whole
   difference between fixing a drift and not noticing one.

The patch targets below reference each tool module's own namespace
(`tools.fetch.classify_guarded`, not `quarantine.classifier.classify_guarded`)
because `from X import Y` binds at import time. After the extraction those
seams move into `gateway/defense.py` and the targets here move with them — the
*assertions* are the characterization, the patch targets are plumbing.
