"""Live Layer 3 detection check — opt-in, Gemini only.

Runs the adversarial corpus attacks through the real Q-Agent against a live
Gemini model and asserts detection stays above a floor. This is the one test
that exercises actual semantic detection end to end, rather than the mocked
fixtures in ``test_l3_integration.py``.

Gating (so it never runs where it shouldn't):

- Skipped unless BOTH ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` is set AND ``TRENTINA_LIVE_L3=1``. That
  keeps it out of normal local ``pytest`` runs and out of fork-PR CI, where
  secrets are unavailable.

Outage tolerance (so a provider hiccup never reddens a PR):

- Transient failures (503/429/timeouts) are retried with exponential backoff.
- If, after retries, too few calls completed — a provider outage rather than a
  code regression — the test SKIPS as inconclusive instead of failing.
- A genuine detection drop among the calls that *did* complete fails the build.

Point it at a reliably-served model with ``QUARANTINE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash``;
``gemini-2.5-flash-lite`` is prone to capacity 503s under load.
