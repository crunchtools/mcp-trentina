"""Delivery decision for a payload over the admission cap.

The contract, from CLAUDE.md "Layer 2 scanning limits" and
docs/defense-pipeline.md:

- block and redact refuse an oversize payload at admission, with no L2 or L3
  call; nothing partial is ever judged clean for them.
- flag is the security-researcher grant: it delivers the bytes EXACTLY as they
  arrived, reads the token-bounded head with L2 and L3, and says so in
  ``_trentina_warning`` (``l2_truncated``, ``l3_truncated``). It never
  reports the payload as clean.
