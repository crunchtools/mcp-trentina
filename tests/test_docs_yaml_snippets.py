"""Every YAML snippet we publish must load.

`docs/defense-pipeline.md` published a `defense:` block with `sanitize`,
`classify` and `quarantine` keys. `DefenseConfig` removed those deliberately
(owner's call, 2026-09-13) and is `extra="forbid"`, and a profile that fails
to load is fatal — `__init__.py` refuses to start rather than expose a gateway
whose policy it could not read. So an operator copy-pasting our own
documentation took the perimeter down, and nothing in CI said a word.

That is the failure this file exists to make impossible. The doc fix was a
two-line edit; this test is the actual deliverable, because the edit only
fixes the snippets that were wrong today.

Scope, and why it stops where it does:

* Blocks whose top level is ``profiles:`` go through the real loader. That is
  the whole path an operator's file takes, env-var indirection included.
* Blocks whose top level is ``backends:`` are validated per entry against
  ``Backend``. They are the other shape we publish enough of to get wrong.
* Anything else — a bare ``tools_allow:`` list, a ``parameter_guards:``
  fragment — is skipped and SAID SO in the test id. A fragment has no single
  model to check it against, and quietly passing over it would make this file
  look like it covers more than it does.

Secrets are the one thing a snippet cannot carry, so every ``*_env:`` name a
snippet mentions is set to a dummy for the duration. That is not a
compromise: what is being checked is the SCHEMA, and a snippet naming an env
var nobody has set is still a snippet an operator can use.

PROPOSED SCHEMA. A design document may legitimately show config for something
that is not built — ``docs/token-routing.md``'s ``delegation:`` section is a
worked proposal, and no commit has ever added a ``DelegationConfig``. Such a
block is marked ``<!-- trentina:proposed -->`` in the source, which both tells
a reader it will not load and tells this file to skip it.

The marker is counted, not merely honoured. ``test_proposed_blocks_are_the_ones_we_know_about``
pins the exact set, so marking a snippet as proposed is a visible change to
this file rather than a quiet way to silence a failure. That is the whole
point: the escape hatch has to cost something, or it becomes the fix.
