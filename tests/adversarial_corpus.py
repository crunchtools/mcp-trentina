"""Adversarial corpus for Layer 3 (Q-Agent) detection benchmarking.

This is the shared source of truth for:

- ``tests/test_adversarial_corpus.py`` — non-API integrity tests that prove
  each attack genuinely reaches Layer 3 (bypasses L1 structural stripping and,
  where deterministic, the L2 classifier).
- ``benchmarks/provider_benchmark.py`` — the cross-provider detection benchmark
  for issue #43.

Design intent
-------------
Layer 1 strips *structural* attacks: hidden HTML, zero-width characters, base64
blobs, markdown-image exfiltration URLs, and literal LLM delimiter tokens
(``<|im_start|>``, ``[INST]``, ``\\n\\nHuman:``). Layer 2 (Prompt Guard 2) is
trained on *instruction-override syntax* ("ignore previous instructions", "you
are now a…"). Both are fast and cheap, and both are categorically blind to
attacks phrased as ordinary prose.

The attacks below are deliberately nasty: they carry no delimiter tokens, no
"ignore previous instructions" phrasing, no encoded payloads, and no
markdown-image beacons. They are injections that only survive as *meaning* —
social pretext, action requests that look like helpfulness, second-order
instructions, and attacks aimed at the detector itself. That is precisely the
gap L3 exists to close, and precisely where providers diverge.

Provenance notes on individual cases cite the public research that inspired the
pattern (Willison's lethal trifecta, the OpenClaw disclosures in issue #29, the
Prompt Guard 2 benchmark in issue #17).
