"""`full` and `defend_json` are the same scan, and this proves it before we delete one.

`read_everything` selects every string leaf and hands them to `defend_scan_view`.
`defend_json` walks every string leaf and judges them itself. Two walks,
written twice, reaching the same verdict — `jsonwalk.py`'s predecessor docstring
says so and warns that "if the two walks ever disagree about what counts as a
leaf, the accounting in S3 stops meaning anything."

`full` is being deleted, because under one driver role "scan everything" is
what an empty processor chain already means. But `full` is not dead weight:
the degrade path in ``gateway/selection.py`` uses it, and that path is the
one whose failure mode is "scanned nothing, looked clean". Deleting it means
rewriting the fail-open path, so the order is not negotiable:

  1. This test passes.
  2. The degrade path is rewritten to call ``defend_json``.
  3. Only then is ``full.py`` deleted.

This file is step 1. It stays afterwards, because the property it checks —
that the two ways of scanning a whole document agree — is what makes step 2
safe, and it is the thing a future change to either walk would break silently.

What is compared: the leaf texts the judge sees, the merged L1 statistics, and
the resulting risk level. Not the object identity of the verdict, and not
timing.
