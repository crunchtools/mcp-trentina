"""Tests for the pre-processor framework: petit and composition.

The properties that matter most here are the security ones:

* Words are never normalized, so a semantic payload buried in boilerplate
  keeps its own fingerprint and SURVIVES reduction — it reaches the
  perimeter scan instead of vanishing into a group.
* What reduction drops is never delivered, so colliding a payload into a
  boilerplate group deletes it rather than smuggling it.
* An LLM touching the payload anywhere in the chain marks the outcome as
  model output, which the perimeter answers with unconditional L3.

    """Unpinning the driver hands an attacker a lever. Bound it.

    Until 0.22.0 `preprocess/petit.py` passed `driver="RawEntry"`, which meant
    petit never ran format detection and every payload got the same neutral
    normalization. Dropping that pin is the point of #95 — it is how Trentina
    finally gets petit's format knowledge — but it opens something the pin had
    closed:

    petit picks its driver by sampling the buffer. An attacker who controls
    PART of a tool response therefore has a say in which driver wins, and the
    winning driver's generalization table is applied to the WHOLE payload.
    Splice sshd-shaped lines into a Jira comment and `SecureLogHash`'s rules
    could be applied to content they were never designed for.

    Three things bound it, and none of them should be weakened without
    replacing this test: `SecureLogEntry.tally_logic` demands unanimity across
    the sample rather than a plurality; `sample_indices` spreads its sample
    evenly, so a contiguous injected block cannot dominate unless it is most
    of the payload; and the chosen driver rides in the sidecar, so a
    surprising reduction is attributable after the fact.

    Note what is NOT claimed. An attacker who supplies most of the payload
    does get the driver they want — at which point they are reducing their own
    content, and what they can achieve is deletion of it. The risk this guards
    is the minority-splice: a few lines steering the treatment of someone
    else's data.
