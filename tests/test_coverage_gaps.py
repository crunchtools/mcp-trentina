"""Every known gap in docs/defense-pipeline.md#known-gaps, held open by a test.

Each test asserts that a documented gap STILL EXISTS. When a change closes
one, its test fails on purpose: delete the test, and move the gap's row in
the Coverage table and its Known gaps entry in the same change. The docs
cannot claim a gap that the code has closed, or close one the code has not.

Gaps that only an LLM run or a measurement can show (L3's false positives,
OCR limits) are documented with the benchmark that measured them instead.
