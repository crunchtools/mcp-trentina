# MCP Trentina CrunchTools Container
# Three-layer defense: deterministic checks + a local classifier (L2) + quarantined LLM
# Built entirely on Hummingbird Python images (Red Hat hardened, minimal)
#
# Build: the GHA pipeline, and only the GHA pipeline.
# .github/workflows/container.yml builds and pushes quay.io/crunchtools/trentina.
# Do NOT build this image by hand — building outside the pipeline causes drift.
#
# No build secret is needed: the one L2 model the image ships is ungated.
# Until 0.59.0 it also shipped Meta's gated Prompt Guard 2, which took an
# HF_TOKEN build argument; that model fails the obfuscation gate below and
# was dropped (#362).
#
# Run (Streamable HTTP on port 8019):
#   podman run --rm \
#     --env-file ~/.config/mcp-env/trentina.env \
#     -v ~/.local/share/trentina:/data:Z \
#     -p 127.0.0.1:8019:8019 \
#     quay.io/crunchtools/trentina \
#     --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8019
#
# Optional D-Bus integration (for Cockpit plugin / mcp-assayer):
#   Add: -v /run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:z
#   D-Bus is optional — the server runs fine without it (--no-dbus is implicit
#   when the socket is not mounted).
#
# With Claude Code (stdio):
#   claude mcp add trentina \
#     -- podman run -i --rm \
#     --env-file ~/.config/mcp-env/trentina.env \
#     -v ~/.local/share/trentina:/data:Z \

# Dependencies come from uv.lock, not from a fresh resolve (issue #79). Every
# dependency in pyproject.toml is floor-pinned with no upper bound, so a plain
# `pip install .` here built the production image against whatever had been
# released that morning — the artifact that actually runs was the least pinned
# thing we owned, and it was resolved separately from the set CI tested.
#
# The `matrix` and `bridge` extras must appear in BOTH places below or the
# dependency is half-installed: `--extra matrix --extra bridge` puts vodozemac
# and matrix-nio in the exported, hash-pinned requirements, and
# `.[matrix,bridge]` on the final --no-deps install is what records
# it against the project. Exporting without installing gives you a verified
# wheel nobody imports; installing without exporting gives you an unpinned one.
#
# `uv export` emits hashes, so this is also a verified install. The project
# itself goes in second with --no-deps so pip cannot re-resolve around the lock.
#
# The requirements go in with --no-deps too (#370). The export is the whole
# locked set, so pip has nothing to resolve, and letting it try is what broke
# the build: rapidocr asks for `opencv-python`, the lock replaces that with
# `opencv-python-headless` (pyproject.toml, [tool.uv]), and pip, reading
# rapidocr's own metadata, went looking for the one the lock had removed.
#
# petit-log-crunchtools used to be held out of this export and installed from
# a hashed source archive, because it resolved from a git tag and pip refuses
# a VCS requirement under hash checking. It reached PyPI as of 4.1.1 (issue
# #96), so it is now an ordinary locked, hash-verified dependency like every
# other one and needs no special case here.

# the build proves it: every corpus attack is classified plain and under six
# transforms by the classifier code this image runs, and the result is
# written into the model's manifest. A model that fails stops the build
# here. The gateway warns at startup about a model with no passing record
# and refuses to start on one under TRENTINA_REQUIRE_HARDENED.
