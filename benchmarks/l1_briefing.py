"""Does L1's briefing help L3? An ablation of the Layer contract's findings.

L1 is count-only: it never changes what L2 or L3 read, and its one lever on
L3 is the briefing (``build_l3_briefing`` names each non-zero count). This
measures whether that lever does anything. Every payload is unpacked as
``defend()`` does it (decoded and labelled, #367), then goes through real L1
and real L2, then L3 twice over:

- ``full``: the production briefing, L1's findings by type.
- ``ablated``: the same briefing built from empty L1 stats, so L3 is told
  "no known patterns". L2's line and the caveat are identical.

Where L1 found nothing the two briefings are the same string, so only the
``full`` arm runs. Each arm is called ``--reps`` times and majority-voted;
the agreement rate is L3's own noise floor, against which a flip is read.

The pipeline verdict is reported too: L1's own refusal (high/critical) or L2
or L3, against L2 or the ablated L3 — L1's whole contribution, briefing and
vote together.

Payload sets: the semantic corpus plain, both its attacks and its benign
cases under the six transforms of ``l2_obfuscation.py``, and the L1 pattern
cases (attacks and near-misses). The semantic corpus is built to slip past
L1, so the transformed and pattern sets are where L1 has something to say.

Needs a loaded L2 model and an L3 key, as the gateway does:
