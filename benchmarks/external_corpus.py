"""The external corpus: ``jackhhao/jailbreak-classification`` (issue #85).

A third-party labeled set, so the benchmark stops grading the defense only
against attacks its own author wrote, and so the FP rate has a denominator
in the hundreds instead of 9.

It is DIRECT jailbreak (user-to-model, DAN-style persona attacks), not
indirect injection in retrieved content, which is Trentina's threat model.
It measures L2 (Prompt Guard 2 is trained on exactly this syntax) and
over-triggering on benign roleplay. It says little about L3's semantic
gap; the internal corpus stays that measurement.

Pinned to one dataset revision and checked by SHA-256, so a result names
exactly what it was measured on. Downloaded on first use into
``benchmarks/data/`` (gitignored): the repo does not vendor 1.6 MB of
jailbreak prompts.
