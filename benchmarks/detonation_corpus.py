"""What the detonation spike reads: carriers, inserts, and where they come from (#357).

A **carrier** is a benign document of the kind an agent fetches mid-task. An
**insert** is text spliced into the middle of one: an attack, or benign text
that only looks like instructions. The spike (``benchmarks/detonation.py``)
hands the result to a model as a tool result and watches what it does next.

Attack inserts come from three places:

* the internal corpus (``tests/adversarial_corpus.CORPUS``), unchanged;
* ``ACTION_ATTACKS`` below, six per class of what injections against agents
  ask for (``docs/benchmark.md`` names the sources): a link or image that
  carries data out, reading a secret and sending it, running remote code,
  misusing a business tool, persistence, and a step dressed as part of the
  user's task;
* InjecAgent's data-stealing instructions (MIT), downloaded at a pinned
  commit and checked by SHA-256 like ``external_corpus``: half as written,
  half behind the benchmark's "enhanced" prefix.

Everything written here follows the corpus's placeholder rules: reserved
``.example`` hosts, no real person, product or address.
