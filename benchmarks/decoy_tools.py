"""Spike: would decoy tools catch what the judge's verdict misses? (#357)

The idea: declare a few tools to an L3 call that nothing will ever execute.
If the model emits a function call, the content it was reading took it
over, whatever its JSON verdict says. This measures whether that happens
where it would matter.

Each case is asked once **as today** (the judge's prompt pack, no tools, the
response schema enforced), then once per arm with decoys declared and
``tool_choice: auto``. An arm is a decoy set and a system prompt:

* decoy sets: ``neutral`` names an agent's ordinary tools (send mail, write
  a file), ``hostile`` names what an attack wants (``exfiltrate_password``,
  ``send_token``). The first run of this spike used only the neutral set,
  and the model called those on benign text: a tool that could plausibly be
  used on any document is used on any document.
* prompts: ``judge`` is the pack's detection prompt unchanged, which says
  there are no tools; ``forbid`` adds a line saying tools are listed and
  must never be called; ``bait`` is not a judge at all, only "summarize
  this", the plain reader an injection is written for.

``--design two-call`` (the default) sends the arm's call without the
response schema, as a second call that is only the tripwire. ``one-call``
keeps the schema on it; the ``bait`` prompt has no verdict to give and is
left out there.

Three numbers decide it (the issue's own):

1. the trip rate on attacks the judge calls clean today. A tripwire that
   only fires on attacks the verdict already catches adds nothing;
2. the trip rate on benign content, which has to be about zero;
3. what the decoys cost in tokens and latency.

Nothing here is wired into the gateway. ``providers/base.enforce_no_tools``
still refuses any request with a ``tools`` key, and this script builds its
own request to get around that on purpose.
