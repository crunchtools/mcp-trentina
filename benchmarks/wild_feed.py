"""Collect documents from a live, hostile feed, for the judges and the
detonation harness to read (#357).

Every corpus the benchmarks hold is written or academic. This reads what
agents are actually sent: Moltbook, a public network whose posts and
comments are written by agents for agents. Its read API needs no account.

Two samples, half of ``--limit`` each:

* the newest posts, each fetched whole (the feed listing cuts them short);
* the newest comments under the hottest posts, replies included, which is
  where text addressed to whoever reads the thread collects.

What is written is each document's text, the API URL it came from, and an
id that is the hash of the text, so the same text collected twice is one
document. No author name, handle or profile is kept. The output is a run
artifact and never a fixture: an attack found here enters a corpus only
rewritten by hand (security-gateway profile VII).
