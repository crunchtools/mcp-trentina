"""What a withheld Matrix event's ``m.relates_to`` may keep (#296).

A withheld event is replaced by a notice, and the notice keeps the event's
relation so a thread, reply or edit still points where it did. The relation
arrived with the event and was not judged, so it is rebuilt from an
allowlist rather than copied: a key nobody listed (``note``, an MSC's
extension, anything a sender invents) is where an injection rides past a
verdict that withheld the body. One rule for the bridge's notice
(``matrix_bridge/core.py``) and the proxy's (``matrix_proxy.py``).

Kept: ``rel_type`` from a closed set, ``event_id``, ``m.in_reply_to.event_id``
and a boolean ``is_falling_back``. Every ID must have an event ID's shape
and not read as words.
``m.annotation`` is not kept, and neither is its ``key``: a reaction key is
free text the sender chose, and a notice is not a reaction.
