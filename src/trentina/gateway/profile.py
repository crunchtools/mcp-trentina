    There are deliberately NO on/off switches for the layers (owner's call,

    booleans, and production ran `quarantine: false` for months without the
    owner knowing — partly because none of it was wired, partly because
    three unrelated words hid what they controlled. A profile behind
    Trentina gets all three layers, full stop; what a profile controls is
    THRESHOLDS (how suspicious before a layer flags or escalates) and the
    ENFORCEMENT consequence. A layer that is genuinely unavailable at
    runtime (no ONNX model, provider down) is a degraded state that /health
    reports and block-mode refuses on — never a config option that fails
    silent.

    There is no cost control for L3 any more, and that is the point. It used
    to live in an `l3_threshold` key, which meant clean traffic never reached the
    judge — and since L2 FLAGS at `l2_threshold` while escalation needed
    that gate, there was a band L2 flagged that L3 never reviewed.

    That was read as satisfying "all three layers, full stop" because it
    removed the per-layer booleans. It did not: a threshold deciding whether
    a layer executes is an off switch with a dial on it. The mandate is that
    L1, L2 and L3 run on every input to the gateway. They do, and
    the key no longer exists and a profile setting it fails to load.

    What a profile still controls is `l2_threshold` — how suspicious L2 must
    be before it FLAGS, which is a consequence and not an execution — and
    `enforcement`, which is what a flag costs.

class OAuthConfig(BaseModel):
    """Per-profile Google-backed OAuth access, opt-in on top of static bearer.

    A profile always carries a static bearer (``auth``). When ``oauth.enabled``
    is set it ALSO accepts a Google-backed OAuth token whose verified email is
    in ``allowed_emails`` — the seat for a client that cannot send a static
    ``Authorization`` header (gemini.google.com Custom Apps, which offers only
    "no auth" or OAuth). The static token keeps working for every other client.

    There is no secret in this block: the UPSTREAM Google client credentials are
    a gateway-wide setting (``TRENTINA_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`` /
    ``_CLIENT_SECRET``), not per-profile, and the DOWNSTREAM client secret is
    named here by env var rather than written here. What a profile holds is the
    authorization decision — who may use it — which is not a secret and belongs
    in the config the operator reads.

    ``client_id``/``client_secret_env``/``client_redirect_uris`` declare a
    statically provisioned CONFIDENTIAL client of OUR authorization server: one
    whose credentials the operator types into a third-party console rather than
    one that registers itself through DCR. See CHANGELOG 0.9.0.

    ``issuer``/``audience_env`` select the other mode entirely: DELEGATED. The
    profile stops using Trentina as an authorization server and names an
    external one, so the client authenticates straight to that IdP and hands us
    the token it minted. We verify it and apply ``allowed_emails`` — the only
    authorization decision this block ever really made.

    gemini.google.com Custom Apps is why delegated mode exists. Its connector
    offers an MCP server URL, a Client ID and a Client Secret and NO
    authorization or token URL, so it reads our RFC 9728 document, finds
    Trentina named as the authorization server, and refuses to token-exchange
    against an AS it has no relationship with: ``/authorize``, ``/consent`` and
    ``/auth/callback`` all complete and ``POST /token`` is never issued at all.
    Naming Google in that document instead is what unblocks it.

    The two modes are mutually exclusive — see
    ``delegated_excludes_provisioned_client``. In delegated mode ``audience`` is
    the security boundary, not a formality: a Google token verifies for ANY
    OAuth client unless its ``aud`` is pinned, so without it every third-party
    app an allowlisted human ever authorized would hold a credential for this
    profile. See ``docs/authentication.md`` and RT #1502.
