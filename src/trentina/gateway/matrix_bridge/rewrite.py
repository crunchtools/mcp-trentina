"""Translate the IDs inside an event's content from one side to the other.

Runs AFTER the verdict, on content that was judged as it arrived. It changes
identifiers only — event IDs in relations, user IDs in mentions, and the
agent's own ID where it appears in the text — so nothing it writes is prose
and nothing it writes was unjudged.

A relation that points at an event the other side never saw is dropped rather
than left dangling. The one exception is a reaction: it has no content of its
own, so a reaction to an unknown event means nothing and is not delivered.

The event IDs a relation points at are therefore never delivered as written:
each is replaced from the mapping table or dropped. ``judged_view`` leaves
them out of what the layers read, because an opaque ID reads to a classifier
as encoded text and withheld every reaction and reply that carried one.
