"""Decoy tools and planted credentials: alarms with no model behind them (#357).

A ``decoy://`` backend's tools are declared in the profile and answered by
nothing. An agent doing its job has no reason to call one, so a call is
evidence that something else is steering it. A honeytoken is a fake
credential planted where only an attacker's instructions lead; one appearing
in the arguments of any call, to any backend, is the same evidence.

Both checks are exact and deterministic: a tool name, a substring. Neither
reads the content that caused the call. The audit's ``session`` and
``call_ref`` columns are what lead back to that.

What this does not see: a planted credential the agent encoded, split or
paraphrased before sending it (``tests/test_coverage_gaps.py`` holds that
open), and anything an agent does without a tool call through the gateway.
