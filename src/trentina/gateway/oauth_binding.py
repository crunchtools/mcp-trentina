"""Bind every token the OAuth proxy issues to the one profile it was issued for.

The proxy holds one JWT audience for the whole gateway (FastMCP's
``OAuthProxy`` stores a single resource URL), so before #298 a token minted
for an agent-role profile verified at an operator-role profile that
allowlisted the same email. The allowlist was the only line between seats,
and an agent that holds its own seat's token is exactly the caller that line
does not stop.

The binding has two halves, both kept in the proxy's own encrypted store:

- **The flow.** ``/authorize`` resolves the RFC 8707 ``resource`` to a profile
  and records it under ``(client_id, code_challenge)``. Those two are what the
  authorization code carries back to ``/token``; FastMCP's code record has no
  resource field, and the PKCE challenge is unique per flow.
- **The token.** ``/token`` consumes the flow record and binds the issued
  token's upstream token set, which a refresh keeps, so every access token in
  the lineage answers to the same profile.

A token with no binding is refused at verify, which is what a token issued
before 0.49.0 is: its client re-authorizes once. A gateway with one proxied
profile binds a flow with no indicator to that profile; with more, a flow
that names none is refused at ``/authorize`` rather than issued a token that
could never be used.
