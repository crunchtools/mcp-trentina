"""Drop startup-only secrets from ``os.environ`` once they are held (#268).

One environment holds every profile's bearer and LLM key, the OAuth signing
key and the upstream Google secret. Code execution in this process can read
all of it through ``os.environ``. This removes the ones nothing reads after
startup, so reading ``os.environ`` later finds nothing, and neither does any
child process.

It does NOT protect ``/proc/self/environ``. The kernel serves that file from
the process's initial environment block, which ``unsetenv`` never rewrites,
so every value is still there for anything that can read the file (checked:
a popped variable still appears in it). The real fix for a secret is its
``_FILE`` form, which never enters the environment at all.

What is popped, and why each is safe:

- ``TRENTINA_OAUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`` and ``TRENTINA_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET``
  are read once in ``_build_oauth_context``, and the provider derives its keys
  from them there. Enabling OAuth later needs a restart anyway.
- The ``Config`` keys (``GEMINI_API_KEY``, ``OPENAI_API_KEY``,
  ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``, ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY``) are read once, into the
  ``get_config()`` singleton, which is built before the scrub.
- Each ``llm_providers`` entry's ``api_key_env``: read by ``load_llm_providers``
  at startup, and ``reload_profiles`` refuses to change that section.

What is kept: every name a profile resolved a secret from
(``loader.profile_env_names``), because ``reload_profiles`` resolves them
again. A name on both lists is kept. A reload that introduces a reference to a
name already popped fails closed with the loader's usual "not set" error and
the running config stays; use the ``_FILE`` form for it.
