"""Guards — deterministic allow/deny checks on what crosses the gateway.

Two symmetric applications of one evaluator:

- **Parameter guards** inspect the *arguments* of a ``tools/call``, after the
  tool-name allowlist and before the backend is contacted.
- **Response guards** inspect the backend's *result*, after the call returns
  and before anything is reduced, scanned or relayed to the agent.

Both express the same constraint — a value must match at least one ``allow``
pattern and must not match any ``deny`` pattern, the same semantics as
tools_allow/tools_deny — and both fail closed on the whole call rather than
editing what passes. A missing value is not checked, on either side.

Response guards exist because request-side matching cannot see what a semantic
tool returns. An agent asking a memory backend for "my employer's roadmap"
sends no matchable token; the restricted material arrives in the response. The
guard is a literal content filter, so a paraphrase defeats it — it is egress
policy for known terms, not a classifier.
