"""Posture lint for profiles.yaml (#269, from the #90 audit).

The loader decides whether a profiles file is VALID. This decides whether it
is SAFE, in three ways the #90 audit found live:

- ``shared-write-backend``: two profiles reach the same backend URL and both
  hold a write tool on it. Whatever one writes the other can read, which is a
  message board between agents unless someone decided it should be one. That
  decision is recorded in an optional top-level ``shared_backends`` list,
  which the loader ignores::

      shared_backends:
        - url: "http://mcp-memory:8000/mcp"
          profiles: [kagetora, takeda]
          reason: "shared memory is the point of this pair (RT #1234)"

- ``toxic-flow``: one seat holds open fetch, a public inbox (alert ingress or
  Matrix) and an outbound-comms tool with no parameter guard. Untrusted input
  arrives, instructions can be fetched, and something can be sent out: the
  incident's shape in one profile.
- ``require-default-open``: a ``TRENTINA_REQUIRE_*`` switch whose default is
  not fail-closed.

Both posture checks are for seats that run unattended, such as swarm or
coding agents. A personal assistant that a person talks to directly holds
broad tools on purpose, so declare it, with a reason, in an optional top-level
``assistants`` list, which the loader also ignores::

      assistants:
        profiles: [josui, kagetora]
        reason: "personal assistants, used interactively; broad tools intended"

An assistant is exempt from ``toxic-flow``. A shared write backend is still
flagged when any profile on it is not an assistant, because an unattended
seat writing where an assistant reads is the channel this check is for.
Every profile not listed is linted, so a new seat is checked by default.

Tool names are judged from the allowlist alone, because the lint runs without
the backends. A wildcard counts as holding whatever it could admit: a glob that
admits a write tool the backend adds next month holds it already.

    python -m trentina.gateway.profile_lint /config/profiles.yaml

exits 1 with one line per finding, 0 when clean, 2 when the file cannot be read.
