"""The L2 benign gate: content a model must not refuse (#411, #404).

The obfuscation gate (``obfuscation.py``) selects for a model that reads
encoded text as possibly hostile. Nothing held the other side: the default
model went into production flagging routine operations output, and the first
measurement of it was the audit log. This gate is that other side. A model,
at the threshold it ships with, is run over benign content of the shapes the
gateway delivers (``tests/benign_corpus.py``), read as the gateway reads it,
and may flag at most :data:`BENIGN_MAX_RATE` of the held-out cases.

The result is recorded in the model's ``trentina-model.json``
(``benchmarks/l2_benign.py --record``, run by the image build beside the
obfuscation gate). ``classifier.resolve_model`` reads the record and
``posture.check_l2_gate`` acts on it at startup. Both gates must pass at one
threshold: raising it to pass this one can fail the other, and the build
runs both.
