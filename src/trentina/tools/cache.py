"""Cache management tool — flush backend and profile tool list caches.

Scoped by role. An agent profile drops its own aggregate and nothing else;
the operator flushes the gateway.

An agent's flush used to evict its backends' entries from the tool-list
cache and report which were still warm (``backends_flushed``). That cache is
keyed by URL and shared by every profile holding the URL, so one profile
could re-list, flush a chosen subset, and have another read the pattern back:
a bit per shared backend, per round (#263). An agent's flush therefore leaves
the shared cache alone and returns a body built from nothing another profile
can influence. A stale backend list is the operator's to flush, or
``reconnect_backend``'s to re-probe.
