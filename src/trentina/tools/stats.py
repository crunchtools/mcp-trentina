"""Stats tool — quarantine_stats for session and blocklist information.

Scoped by role, because "stats" over a shared database is the widest of the
admin tools. Unfiltered, the 30-day audit lists every backend and tool any
profile called, with volumes, and a detection's ``source`` is written as
``profile:backend:tool`` — so the recent-detections list hands the reader other
agents' names and the URLs they fetched.

An agent profile therefore gets its own rows and its own effective settings.
The operator gets the gateway. Nobody gets a host filesystem path they cannot
act on: ``classifier_model_path`` is an operator field.
