"""Reconnect tool — recover a single backend after it restarts.

There is no persistent MCP transport to a backend (backend.py opens a fresh
streamable-http session per call), so "reconnect" here means clearing the
recovery state that a backend restart leaves stale:

1. Reset the per-URL circuit breaker (``cache_flush`` never touches it, so an
   open circuit otherwise blocks calls until the 60s cooldown probe succeeds).
2. Force a fresh probe/fetch that replaces the cached tool list and records
   breaker success/failure.
3. Invalidate the aggregates that omitted the backend while it failed: the
   caller's own for an agent, every one holding the URL for the operator.

This lets an operator recover one backend without restarting the whole gateway.

Scoped by role. An agent profile reconnects a backend it holds, and hears back
about that one: its endpoint, its circuit, and the tool count AS THAT PROFILE
SEES IT through its own allowlist. The operator reconnects a name wherever it
is configured and is told which profiles share it. A name the caller does not
hold is refused the same way whether or not it exists elsewhere, so a miss is
not a map of the rest of the gateway.

Resetting a circuit is felt by every profile on that URL — the breaker is keyed
by URL and healing it heals it for all of them. That is the point of the tool,
not a leak. An agent's aggregate rebuild is its own (#291): dropping every
profile's that held the URL moved their ``surface.built_at``, which each of
them reads in ``quarantine_stats``.
