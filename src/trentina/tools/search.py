"""Search tools — block_search, flag_search and redact_search.

Search is a producer like any other. L0 (a grounded model call) writes an
answer and cites sources; the answer, every title and every URI become ONE
document, and that document crosses the same three layers as a fetched page.

It used to be special, and special meant weaker: its own recipe, L1 run field
by field and merged, a private ``total_l1 >= 3`` refusal rule, titles and
URIs seen by L1 alone, and no L3 at all in block and flag. L0's output is
model output — written by an LLM after reading whatever the web served it —
so it is judged with ``Provenance.MODEL_OUTPUT``, never trusted more.
