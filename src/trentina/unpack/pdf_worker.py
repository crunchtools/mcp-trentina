"""Read one PDF from stdin and print what it says as JSON (#369).

Run as a child process by ``pdf.read_pdf`` and by nothing else:

    python -m trentina.unpack.pdf_worker < file.pdf

A PDF is the most complicated thing this gateway opens, in a pure-Python
parser with a history of inputs that loop or allocate without end. A thread
cannot be stopped; a process can. So the parse happens here, under a CPU
limit and an address-space limit this process sets on itself, with no
credential in its environment, and the parent kills it at a wall-clock
deadline. Any exception is left to end the process: a PDF that cannot be
read to the end is not half read.

The output is everything a tool handed the file could show an agent:

* the text of each page, split by whether a reader would see it;
* every text-valued entry worth reading in every object of the file
  (annotation contents, form values, link targets, JavaScript, document
  information, alternate text), reached by walking the cross-reference
  table and not the page tree, so an object nothing points to is read too;
* the XMP metadata packet, and each embedded file's bytes up to
  ``MAX_ATTACHED`` in all: a file past that is named with no content, and
  the parent counts it unread. Outline entries are dictionaries with a
  ``/Title``, so the walk above reads them with everything else.

Invisible means drawn so by a named operator: text render mode 3 or 7, a
size under a point once the matrices are applied or a position outside the
page (both judged for text drawn on the page itself, not inside a form), or
a white fill on a page that has painted nothing else. Two things
that look the same are not counted, because they are how ordinary files are
written: white text after a fill, a shading or an image (a dark slide), and
a page that is an image with all of its text invisible (a scan with its OCR
text layer). That text is read as the page's text and the page is reported
as ``text_layers``: nothing here checks that the layer says what the
picture shows, so the parent still counts the picture unread. Text in a hidden optional-content
layer, behind an image or clipped away is read as visible (Known gaps).
