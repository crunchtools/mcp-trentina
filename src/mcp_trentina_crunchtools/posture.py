"""Check the process's own containment at startup (#268).

Trentina holds every profile's bearer, every backend's credential and the
OAuth signing key, so a file-write or code-execution primitive inside it is a
compromise of every agent it serves. The container flags that blunt such a
primitive (``--read-only``, ``--security-opt no-new-privileges``,
``--cap-drop=all``, seccomp) are set by whoever runs it, not by the image,
and nothing told an operator when one was missing.

This reads what the kernel says about the running process and names each gap
in one WARNING. ``TRENTINA_REQUIRE_HARDENED=true`` turns any gap into a
startup failure, for a deployment that would rather not run than run open.

Every name logged is a constant from this module or an environment variable
name the operator set; no value is ever read into a message.

Linux only. Without ``/proc`` the one gap reported is ``unverifiable``.
