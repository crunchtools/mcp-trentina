"""What a log line may carry (#262).

The gateway's log is readable by several agents through other backends'
journal and container-log tools, so a string a caller chose that reaches it
verbatim is a message board between agents, and one that outlives the
session. The rule: never log a string a caller chose — an agent, an OAuth or
HTTP client, a backend, a fetched page, a Matrix sender — nor an exception
whose message may carry one.

What may be logged: a profile name (server-configured), a tool name once it
resolved to a configured tool, ``exc_kind(exc)``, and for anything else
``redact_source(s)``, a fingerprint an operator correlates with the audit
database, which no tool can reach. ``tests/test_log_hygiene.py`` drives every
tool path with a canary at DEBUG and fails if the canary reaches a record,
and fails any ``logger.exception``, ``exc_info`` or bare exception argument
not marked ``# logsafe: ours`` with the reason its text is the server's own.

Third-party loggers that format request data themselves (uvicorn's access
log, httpx, httpcore) are held to the same rule by ``guard()`` and
``install()``, and so is library OAuth code (``fastmcp.server.auth``,
``mcp.server.auth``), whose every interpolated value is fingerprinted.

That rule is about what a call site may pass. The backstop (#341) is about
what a record may carry whoever built it: ``guard()``, run when the package
is imported, installs a ``LogRecord`` factory that every record from every
logger passes through before a handler sees it. A secret ``hold()`` knows is
replaced by the name of the variable it came from; text shaped like a
credential nobody registered is replaced by ``[REDACTED]``. A miss at a call
site, in a library, or in a traceback is then harmless rather than a leak.
``configure()`` is the one place a process sets up logging.
