"""Room keys from the homeserver's encrypted backup.

Trentina holds a recovery key and reads the backup. It does NOT hold a Matrix
device identity, does not upload keys, and makes no request that changes state
on the homeserver. Every call here is a GET.

Three properties are load-bearing rather than incidental:

**The backup's public key is verified at startup.** The recovery key implies a
public key; the homeserver publishes the one the backup was made with. If they
disagree the key is wrong, and that is a refused start rather than a silent
inability to decrypt anything.

**Fetches are per-room, single-flight, and rate-limited.** This is a SECURITY
control, not an optimisation. Session IDs arrive in events, and events come
from room members. Without a cooldown, anyone in a room could send events
carrying fabricated session IDs and turn every ``/sync`` into N homeserver
round-trips inside Trentina's own request path.

**Nothing is persisted.** A Megolm session key is a permanent decryption
capability for its slice of history. ``/data`` already holds the quarantine
database -- attacker-supplied content, and the artifact most likely to be
examined after an incident. Putting room keys beside it would change the blast
radius of a ``/data`` disclosure from "what the attacker already sent" to
"every historical message in every room, for ever". A cold cache is fully
re-derivable from the recovery key, so persistence buys restart latency and
nothing else.
