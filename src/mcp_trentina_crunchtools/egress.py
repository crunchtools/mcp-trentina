"""The one egress guard for every gateway-side fetch (#260).

Trentina sits on the container network beside backends with no auth of their
own, so a URL an agent (or a page it fetched) chooses must never reach them.
Three rules, each closing a way round the one before:

- ``check_url`` resolves the host and refuses unless EVERY answer is a global
  address. Deciding on the resolved address, not the spelling, is what
  catches ``2130706433``, ``0x7f.1`` and a single-label container name.
- ``PinnedBackend`` connects to the address that was checked. Resolving again
  at connect time would let a DNS answer that changes in between (rebinding)
  swap the target after the check passed. TLS still verifies the hostname:
  httpcore passes the URL's host as ``server_hostname``, not the pinned IP.
- ``open_guarded`` follows redirects itself and checks every hop, because a
  public page that redirects inward is the same attack by other means.
- It asks for ``identity`` and refuses a body that arrives encoded anyway
  (#276). httpx decompresses before any caller can count, so a size cap on
  a gzip or brotli body is checked after the bomb has gone off.

``TRENTINA_FETCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE`` lifts the address rule only.
