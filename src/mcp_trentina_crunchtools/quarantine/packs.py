"""L3 prompt packs: the judge's prompts, per model (#354).

L3 sent the same three system prompts to every provider and model. Wording
that helps one model costs another: Red Hat's guardrail benchmark measured
10 to 18 points of accuracy in the policy text alone, and a policy tuned
for one model losing points on the next. A pack is the three system prompts
and the Layer 2 caveat for one exact ``(provider, model)``. A model with no
pack gets the generic prompts in ``prompts.py``, as before.

What a pack is not allowed to be:

* **A schema.** It carries prompts and nothing else. The response schemas
  and ``FINDING_TYPES`` stay where they are, so L3's output stays closed
  whatever a pack says (``schema.py``). A key this module does not know
  refuses the pack.
* **A way to drop the framing.** Every system prompt must still say that
  the judge has no tools and that instructions in the content are to be
  ignored (``FRAMING``). A pack without those sentences is refused at load.

Which pack a call uses is decided when the call is made, from the judge that
is actually answering: under the provider fallback chain that can be a
different model from the profile's primary, and it gets its own pack or the
generic one. An operator's pack (``defense.l3_prompt_pack`` or
``TRENTINA_L3_PROMPT_PACK``) applies to the model it names and to no other.
Either setting may say ``generic`` instead of a path: no pack at all, for an
operator who wants a shipped pack out of the way.

A pack's id and a hash of its text are its ``stamp``. The stamp is in the
verdict key (``gateway/ingress_defense._cache_key``), so editing a prompt
sweeps the verdicts it reached, as switching the L2 model does.
