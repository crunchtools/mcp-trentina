"""Layer 2 — a local prompt-injection classifier via ONNX Runtime.

Embedded in-process inference. No sidecar, no HTTP API, no network calls.
Synchronous — ONNX inference is CPU-bound, not I/O-bound.

Which model is pluggable (#350): any sequence-classification ONNX export in a
directory, described by a ``trentina-model.json`` manifest (or, failing one,
by the labels in its ``config.json``). The image ships Horizon-Labs'

onnxruntime's C++ init reads this, so it has to land before the lazy

container.

With telemetry live, importing onnxruntime reads /etc/machine-id, reads
/etc/os-release four times, reads /proc/cpuinfo, writes a debug log to
/tmp/mat-debug-1.log and creates a session file at /tmp/.ses. None of that
belongs in a process whose job is handling untrusted content. Disabling
leaves only the /sys/class/drm and /sys/class/accel probes onnxruntime
genuinely needs to choose an execution provider.

It is also a second line of defence against the import-time segfault the
Containerfile addresses: the machine-id read that trips a shell-less image
sits on this same telemetry path, so either mitigation alone prevents it.

    Padding to ``max_length`` was making every short input cost a full
