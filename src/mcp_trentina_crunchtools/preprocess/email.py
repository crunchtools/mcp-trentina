"""Email — FREE reduction for mail-shaped tool output.

Phase 3 of the reduction plan, and the sleeper: mail was the highest
bytes-per-call of the three shapes in the sidecar, and almost all of that
weight is boilerplate the reader has already seen.

A reply quotes the message it answers. A thread of eight messages therefore
carries the first message eight times, the second seven times, and so on —
quadratic repetition that no line-level grouper catches, because the copies
are not identical lines: each nesting level adds another ``> ``.

Two rules, both deterministic, both deletion:

* **Quoted blocks.** A run of consecutive quoted lines keeps its first few
  and counts the rest. Where petit collapses lines that are the same, this
  collapses lines that are marked as already-said.
* **Signatures.** ``-- `` on a line of its own is the RFC 3676 §4.3 sign-off
  delimiter. What follows is contact details and legal boilerplate, repeated
  identically on every message its author ever sends.

Deliberately NOT here: collapsing footers and disclaimers that repeat across
the messages in a batch. Those are identical lines, which is exactly petit's
job — run this and then petit, which is what the ``chain`` strategy in
``compose.py`` is for. A reducer that reimplements the reducer next to it is
how two subtly different grouping rules end up in one pipeline.

Security. Everything here deletes; nothing rewrites. A payload hidden in a
quoted block or a signature is dropped, and a dropped line is never
delivered, so there is nothing to smuggle. The inverse is the real caveat
and it is the same one petit carries: an attacker who can shape the message
can get a victim's line classified as quotation or signature and thereby
SUPPRESSED. The bound on that is ``_MAX_SIGNATURE_LINES`` — a crafted ``-- ``
cannot swallow an unlimited tail — plus the counts, which still show that
lines existed. Every marker this module writes is in-band and therefore
spoofable; consumers must treat reduced output as untrusted, which the
perimeter already assumes.

Hostile-input hardening: every pattern is anchored and linear-time, each
line is examined once, and classification reads at most
``_CLASSIFY_MAX_CHARS`` of a line.
