"""Summarize — METERED reduction via an isolated worker model (#82).

The Spotify result that motivated this: routing bulk reads through a cheap
worker model cut frontier-model token usage ~90%. Trentina's version is a
pre-processor: the worker reads the oversized payload OUTSIDE the perimeter
and emits a compact summary, and it is the summary — not the original —
that crosses the defense pipeline and reaches the agent.

The summarizer is the reason the provenance gate exists. A worker model
reading hostile text can be talked into emitting a payload, and what it
emits is short, fluent, and free of override syntax — the exact shape L2 is
documented to miss. So its output is MODEL_OUTPUT provenance (the
composition layer flips it automatically for any METERED processor) and the
perimeter answers with unconditional L3. Isolation is the Q-Agent's own:
``quarantine_generate`` builds requests with no tools structurally, injects
a per-request canary, and constrains the response to a JSON schema.

The system prompt hardens the worker the same way the Q-Agent's does: the
payload is data to describe, never instructions to follow.

TOOL DESCRIPTIONS (#176, 0.38.0). Compressing a tool's description is the
same act on a different ingress: hand text to a model, take back something
shorter. So ``summarize`` is also the driver on ``Channel.TOOL_DESCRIPTION``,
configured per backend as ``preprocess_tool_descriptions`` (it was the
boolean ``compress_descriptions``), and the batched model call that does it
lives here as ``summarize_descriptions``. ``gateway/compress.py`` is the call
site: which descriptions, the cache, retries, and applying the results. What
comes back is model output, and the tool-list scan judges it as such.
