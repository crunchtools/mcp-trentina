"""Read what could be language; account for everything else.

The reducer for structured payloads. Where ``petit`` collapses repeated lines
and ``structured`` collapses repeated array elements, this one drops the
strings that cannot carry an instruction at all — ciphertext, identifiers,
enum constants, numbers, exact duplicates.

Why it exists: a measured Matrix initial sync was 68,092 characters reaching
the classifier, of which 45,552 were Megolm ciphertext, 13,352 were JSON key
names, 7,617 were key-backup material, and 245 were human-readable prose. The
scan took 46 seconds to read base64 it held no key for. Reading less is not a
shortcut here; it is the difference between a perimeter that runs and one that
times out and is skipped entirely. Takeda measured 17.6x.

Three mechanisms, in order of what they save on that sync:

1. STRUCTURAL SKIPPING (``shapes.classify_skip``) removes ciphertext,
   identifiers, enum constants and numbers — 53 KB of the measured 68 KB.
2. DEDUPLICATION removes repeats. 1,289 key names in that sync are about forty
   distinct strings; every distinct one is still read exactly once. A
   classifier learns nothing from the second ``"origin_server_ts"``, and
   nothing can hide in a duplicate, because hiding requires the string to be
   absent and it is not — it is right there, the first time.
3. SKIP SAMPLING puts the opening of every skipped string into one extra
   segment, so a payload hidden in a field the rules declined still gets its
   first bytes in front of L1 and L2. This is the backstop for the residual
   hole in ``shapes``, and it does not depend on any shape rule being right —
   which is exactly what a backstop should not do.

The sample is deterministic — first N by document order, never random — so an
incident is reproducible from the payload alone.

Two rules bind this processor specifically, and they are the reason it is safe
to skip bytes at all:

SKIPPING IS STRUCTURAL, NEVER SEMANTIC. A string may be skipped only on a
   property of its own shape: charset, length, absence of whitespace, a match
   against an identifier grammar. Never on its meaning, its sender, its room,
   or a classifier's opinion of it. The predicate is a pure function of the
   string. There is no trusted-sender list and there never will be, because
   the sender is the thing an attacker controls most cheaply.

SKIPPING IS ACCOUNTED, AND LOW COVERAGE IS ITSELF A FINDING. Every skipped
   byte is counted by reason. The histogram rides into the audit record and
   into L3's briefing, because "this is the 4% that survived selection" is
   context a judge should have. A scan that read 2% of a document must not
   look like a scan that read all of it.

``tests/test_adversarial_corpus.py`` is what earns the right to skip: for every
case in the corpus, no leaf is skipped, planted as a value, as a key, and
nested in an array.
