"""PDF — FREE conversion of a PDF to the text a reader sees (#369).

A PDF is a reducer format, as HTML is: an agent that fetched a paper wants
its text, and the file itself is megabytes of base64 it cannot use. This
processor turns a PDF into Markdown and drops what the page does not show,
counting it for L1 as ``html.py`` counts hidden elements.

The payload is the PDF as canonical base64: ``client.fetch_url`` hands a
fetched PDF over that way, and a PDF inside a JSON string arrives that way
(``structured.py`` calls ``reduce_base64`` per field). Parsing happens in a
child process (``unpack/pdf.py``); a PDF it cannot read is declined, and
goes on as it arrived for the unpack stage to count as unread.

What is delivered:

* each page's visible text, pages separated by a blank line;
* the links its annotations point to;
* a line for what was left out and why: pages that are images with no
  text, and embedded files. Neither is silently missing.

``trentina_preprocess: false`` delivers the file, and the unpack stage then
reads all of it, invisible text and embedded files included.
