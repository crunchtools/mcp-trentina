"""Detect — look at the payload, then run the minifiers that fit it (0.38.0).

The default pre-processor. Before 0.38.0 a profile listed a chain and every
processor in it tried every payload, each declining what was not its shape.
That works for the reducers, whose declines are cheap and exact. It does not
work for ``html``: its gate is "is there any markup at all", and on text that
merely contains angle brackets it is destructive. Measured before this module
existed, it deleted ``<scott@example.com>`` from a mail header, turned
``Vec<String>`` into ``Vec``, stripped wikitext ``<ref>`` and corrupted JSON
by writing newlines into string values. A converter that is always in the
chain has to be told when to run.

So detection happens once, here, and it is strict in the direction that
deletes nothing:

* **HTML** only when the server SAID so (``PreProcessContext.content_type``)
  or the text is unmistakably a document: a leading doctype or ``<html>``, or
  at least ``_MIN_TAGS`` real tags, one of them structural, and NOT ONE tag
  name that HTML does not define. ``<scott``, ``<String``, ``<ref`` are
  unknown names, so one of them is enough to leave the payload alone. Missing
  a real page costs tokens; mistaking text for a page costs the agent content.
* **JSON** when it is bracketed at both ends. ``structured`` collapses
  repeated elements and re-serializes compactly; it is the one parse, and
  when it says ``not_json`` the payload takes the text path instead.
* **Everything else** goes through ``email`` then ``petit``. Both already
  decline what is not their shape (``email._looks_like_mail``, petit's record
  framing and its own format detection), so asking petit to name the format
  first would parse the payload twice to learn nothing.

HTML is followed by ``petit`` too: a converted page is text, and a listing
page is exactly the repetition petit collapses.

The chain's results are merged into ONE result named ``detect``. ``format``
says which path ran and ``chain`` which processors applied, so a reader of
the sidecar can tell "detected JSON, nothing to collapse" from "detected
text". A processor that broke (``policy.FAILED_DECLINES``) makes the whole
result decline with its reason, so a profile that pins ``detect`` as
``required`` refuses rather than delivers half a transformation.
