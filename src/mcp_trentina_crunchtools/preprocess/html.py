"""HTML — conversion to Markdown, which ELIMINATES an attack class.

Tier 1 of the two-tier answer in ``l1/hidden.py``. This processor is not a
detector that happens to shrink things; it removes the vocabulary that can
express hidden content. Markdown has no ``style`` attribute, no
``display:none``, no ``position:absolute``, no foreground/background pair.
After conversion the category is ABSENT, not mitigated, and there is nothing
left for a detector to find.

That is the whole argument for keeping it in the default chain rather than
treating it as an optional nicety, and the reason a profile that considers
HTML hostile enough can pin it as required rather than agent-selectable.

Lived in ``l1/html.py`` behind a ``looks_like_html`` sniffer until 0.28.0.
The sniffer was the bug: it matched a leading ``<!DOCTYPE`` or ``<html>``, so
an HTML fragment took the text path and was neither converted nor checked.
There is no sniffer here. This processor tries to parse, and DECLINES when
there is nothing to convert — the same shape ``structured.py`` uses with its
bracket gate and ``not_json`` decline. It can therefore sit in the default
chain permanently and no-op on everything that is not markup, which is what
replaces the dispatch rather than relocating it.

COMPOSITION. This is the first processor here that TRANSFORMS without
existing to shrink, the case ``compose.py`` documents as deliberate: it
survives under ``chain`` and under ``auto`` (it is FREE), and loses under
``best_of`` to anything that shrank more. Conversion nearly always does
shrink, since tags outweigh their text, but that is incidental and this
module does not self-decline on size the way the reducers do. Configure it
with ``chain``.

WHAT IT DELETES it deletes, which is invariant 1's permitted direction: a
hidden element's bytes are removed and reach nobody. The counts go to the
sidecar as telemetry and are deliberately NOT load-bearing — if this
processor never runs, ``l1/hidden.py`` still counts the fingerprints on the
raw bytes, which is what keeps the risk score honest without a wire from
outside the perimeter into ``PipelineStats``.

Hostile input is bounded by ``_MAX_PARSE_BYTES``, and the parse runs on a
worker thread: BeautifulSoup is synchronous and a large document must not
stall the gateway's event loop.
