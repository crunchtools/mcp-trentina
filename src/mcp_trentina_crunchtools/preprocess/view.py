"""The scan view: what a reducer read, and an account of what it did not.

Types only. The rules live with the processors that apply them — the skip
grammar in ``select.py``, the decryption posture in ``matrix.py``.

This file was ``scanview/base.py``, the contract of a second driver framework
that #163 called "guard machinery" and #167 undid. The ruling it rested on —
that a pre-processor may never open a gap between what is scanned and what is
delivered — does not survive contact with L1, which has always built a scan
copy that deliberately differs from the delivered bytes. Scan-differs-from-
deliver is the heart of L1, not a violation of it.

What is left after removing that framing is narrower and still true. A
processor that reads less than it delivers owes an ACCOUNT of what it
declined, and this is the shape of that account:

* ``chars_scanned`` + every value in ``skipped_chars`` must equal
  ``chars_total``, exactly. ``accounts()`` checks it and the tests assert it.
  Drift there means a processor dropped content without recording it, which is
  the one bug class the whole design exists to make impossible.
* ``coverage`` below the profile's floor is reported as a finding in its own
  right. A scan that read 2% of a document must not look like a scan that read
  all of it.
* ``degraded`` says the processor fell back. It is never silent.

Which of these bytes reach the agent is the CALL SITE's business, not this
type's: ``gateway/transform.py`` delivers what the chain returned, while
``gateway/matrix_proxy.py`` forwards the upstream ciphertext because the agent
must decrypt for itself (#162). Both use this type; they differ in what they
put on the wire.
