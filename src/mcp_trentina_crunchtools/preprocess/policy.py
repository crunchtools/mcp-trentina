"""Whether a call minifies: one switch, inside the operator's bounds (#183, 0.38.0).

Output is minified by default. ``trentina_preprocess: false`` asks for the
exact text instead, which is what an agent needs before it edits and saves a
document back; ``true`` asks for minification on a tool whose default is
exact. It is a switch, not a menu: 0.37.0 let the agent name processors, and
the one decision an agent actually has is "shorter" or "exact".

The profile sets both bounds, as before:

* ``processors`` is what "minified" runs (default ``[detect]``, which picks
  the minifier by format).
* ``required`` is the FLOOR. Those run on every call, first, and ``false``
  cannot remove them. That is what makes HTML conversion mandatory for a
  profile that considers markup hostile enough.

What the switch can never do is touch ``defend()``. Transformation runs
before the perimeter (``base.py`` invariant 2), so the choice changes what is
scanned only in the sense that it changes what is delivered: the two are
always the same bytes. ``false`` is not unscanned, it is unminified, and
``l1/hidden.py`` still counts what conversion would have removed.

An omitted switch resolves to the tool's default BEFORE anything is checked,
the same rule ``ModePolicy.resolve`` follows, so absence is never a way around
the policy.

Every tool accepts the switch; ``instructions`` says so once per session.
Declaring it in each tool's schema is optional (``selectable``): Claude Code
forwards an undeclared argument, and 376 declarations cost a 376-tool profile ~15 KB.
