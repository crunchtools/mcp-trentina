"""Pre-processor contract — payload TRANSFORMATION outside the perimeter.

Trentina has two mandates: defend the primary model, and save it tokens.
They are served by two mechanisms in two places, deliberately:

* Pre-processors (this package) TRANSFORM payloads. They run outside the
  perimeter, their output is exactly as untrusted as their input, and
  everything they emit crosses the defense pipeline on its way in.
* The defense pipeline (``defense.py``) makes verdicts. It never transforms.

Reduction is the most common transformation, not the only one, and the
package has never been reduction-only. ``volatile.normalize()`` rewrites
timestamps and identifiers into placeholders — the fingerprinting policy
invariant 2 rests on, whose size effect is incidental and goes both ways.
``structured.py`` re-serializes with indentation. Normalizing, restructuring
and filtering are all in scope.

Three invariants, none negotiable:

1. A pre-processor may SUBTRACT, never ABSOLVE. Dropping, collapsing,
   normalizing and restructuring are all permitted — deleting content is
   always safe, because a byte that is deleted reaches no one. What is
   forbidden is the other direction: never mark content clean, never shorten
   or skip ``defend()``, and never let output be trusted more than input.
2. A pre-processor never bypasses ``defend()``. The composition layer hands
   back a transformed artifact; the caller scans THAT artifact and delivers
   THAT artifact. What a processor dropped never reaches the agent at all,
   which is what makes fingerprint-collision games pointless — colliding your
   payload into a collapsed group deletes it.

   That argument is about DELETION specifically, not about getting smaller.
   A processor that rearranges rather than deletes does not inherit it: its
   bytes are still delivered, so it must carry its own reasoning for why
   reshaping them is safe.
3. Every pre-processor accounts for itself. The sidecar (bytes in/out, ratio,
   what was collapsed) reaches L3's briefing, because "this artifact is the
   3% that survived transformation" is context a judge should have. Routing
   it to the audit log as token-mandate evidence is intended and not yet
   built — ``router.py`` reads the sidecar only for the briefing, and
   ``PreProcessOutcome.sidecar()`` has no caller in ``src/``.

COMPOSITION IS STILL SIZE-DRIVEN, even though this contract is not. A
transformation that does not shrink runs under ``chain`` and keeps its output,
runs under ``auto`` if FREE, and loses under ``best_of`` to any processor that
shrank more. Below ``min_bytes`` nothing runs at all, and every FREE processor
here self-declines on ``bytes_out >= bytes_in``. Read ``compose.py`` before
assuming a reshaping processor will survive the strategy you configured.

A FILTERING processor — one that drops records a policy names — is permitted
by invariant 1 and would be a better fit than a whole-response guard for
per-record cases. It is not safe to build on this framework yet: composition
fails OPEN by design (``compose.py`` swallows processor errors and passes the
original through), so a filter that raised would deliver exactly what it
exists to remove. That needs fail-closed handling first.

Pre-processors parse hostile bytes. Regexes here must be linear-time and
fingerprinting must cap the bytes it reads per line — an attacker choosing
the input must not be able to buy quadratic work.
