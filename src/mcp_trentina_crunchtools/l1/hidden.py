"""Hidden-markup fingerprints — the tier-2 backstop, format-agnostic.

Conversion to Markdown (``preprocess/html.py``) is tier 1 and removes this
attack class rather than detecting it: Markdown has no ``style`` attribute, no
``display:none``, no foreground/background pair. Once a payload has been
converted, hidden content is not expressible — the category is absent, not
mitigated.

This stage catches the payloads conversion never saw: the agent asked for raw
bytes, the converter declined, or the text merely embeds markup without being
a document. It makes no decision about whether a payload "is HTML", because
there is no such decision to get wrong. It assumes any payload MAY carry
markup, scans for the fingerprints that hide content, and counts them.

Until 0.28.0 this ran only behind a ``looks_like_html`` sniffer keyed on a
leading ``<!DOCTYPE`` or ``<html>``. An HTML FRAGMENT — the shape most MCP
tool output actually carries — matched neither, so it was never checked at
all: a same-colour span in one scored ``low`` and was delivered intact, while
the identical bytes with a doctype in front scored ``medium`` and were
stripped. Same payload, two security behaviours, chosen by the first few
characters. Removing the sniffer is what this module is for.

COUNTS ONLY; the L2 input passes through untouched. The hidden text's WORDS
are exactly what L2 should still read — what this stage adds is the
structural signal that those words were not meant to be seen, which is the
part no amount of reading the text can recover.

The predicate table lives here and ``preprocess/html.py`` imports it, so the
converter that STRIPS an element and the stage that COUNTS one decide by one
rule. Two hand-maintained copies of a detection table is the bug ``jsonwalk``
was written to end (#167).
