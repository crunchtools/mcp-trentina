"""L1: the deterministic pipeline. It counts, and its counts brief L3.

FORMAT-AGNOSTIC since 0.28.0. There is one entry point and it scans what it
is handed. The ``looks_like_html`` dispatch that used to choose between an
HTML pipeline and a text pipeline is gone: it matched a leading ``<!DOCTYPE``
or ``<html>``, so an HTML FRAGMENT took the text path, and identical bytes
received two different security behaviours depending on their first few
characters. Conversion now belongs to ``preprocess/html.py``, which declines
on what it cannot parse instead of asking whether anything "is HTML", and
hidden-markup fingerprints are counted by an ordinary stage that runs on
every payload. See ``l1/hidden.py`` for the two tiers.
