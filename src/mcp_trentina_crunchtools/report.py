"""The `scan` block: what ran, what was decided, where it came from.

Replaces the `trust` object, which was a lie in the literal sense — it was
named for a property no content in this system ever has. Content that crossed
the perimeter is untrusted, permanently, because the layers are DETECTORS and
a detector finding nothing has not made anything safe. It has failed to find
something, and the gap between those two claims is the false-negative rate:
L2 misses social engineering 40% of the time and exfiltration intent 20%, and
L3 on the default model catches 86% of attacks written to evade L1 and L2,
dropping to 33% on attacks aimed at the detector itself.

So there is no trust ladder here and there must not be one. A label saying
`l3_trusted` would be wrong two times out of three on the attack class that
targets judges, and it would travel into the agent's context telling it to
relax. That converts "the attacker got through" into "the attacker got
promoted", and publishes what to aim at.

`trust.level` collapsed four unrelated questions into one enum, which is how
it ended up meaning nothing: `advisory` and `quarantined` described what was
PRODUCED, `l1-only` and `layer1-fallback` described what RAN, `trusted-l1`
described who VOUCHED, and `blocked` described what was DECIDED. Nothing in
the codebase ever branched on any of them — the value reached one cockpit
table cell, rendered as a text label hardcoded to the "low" risk style, so
not even the UI read it.

Three independent facts, never collapsed:

* **layers** — which layers ran and whether each COMPLETED. A scan that did
  not finish must never read like a scan that found nothing; that is the rule
  ``warning.py`` already enforces for findings, and it applies here too.
* **disposition** — what the caller did about it.
* **origin** — where the bytes came from, and whether an operator has
  allowlisted that source.

WHAT IT FOUND is deliberately NOT here. That is ``_trentina_warning``'s job
and duplicating it would give two answers that can disagree.

ALLOWLISTING CHANGES WHAT A FINDING COSTS; IT NEVER SKIPS A LAYER OR HIDES A
FLAG. Since 0.31.0 an allowlisted source runs all three layers and its flags
stand. What ``origin.allowlisted`` explains is a block that became a redact:
block_* on an allowlisted source hands a flagged payload to the redact path
instead of refusing it, and reports ``disposition: extracted``. A redact that
fails still refuses — allowlisting removes false-positive refusals, it does
not create a channel that survives the redact pipeline giving up.
