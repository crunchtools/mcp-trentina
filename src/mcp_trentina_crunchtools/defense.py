"""The three-layer defense pipeline. One implementation, many callers.

Before this module existed the L1 -> L2 -> L3 *sequence* was written out
longhand in five places: `tools/fetch.py`, `tools/read.py`, `tools/content.py`,
`tools/scan.py`, and `gateway/alert_ingress.py`. The *layers* were always
single clean implementations; it was the recipe for using them that was
copy-pasted. Everyone shared the detectors and re-invented the pipeline.

They had already drifted. L3 was gated on a global API key everywhere and on
`quarantine_threshold` — the field built for the job — nowhere.
`alert_ingress` never read `profile.defense` at all, in the one place the
pipeline actually ran. `safe_*` blocked on L1 risk alone; `quarantine_*` did
not. Four divergences across five copies, none of them written down as a
decision.

Commit 433ff1c fixed this identical disease one floor down, extracting
`_run_text_stages()` from the two L1 entry points, with the reasoning:
"a stage added to one path and not the other would have left plain text
defended differently from HTML, silently, with nothing to catch it." The same
bug lived one level up, across the whole pipeline. A drifting sub-stage misses
one class of attack; a drifting pipeline skips an entire layer for an entire
ingress path.

## What this module does and does not decide

`defend()` decides *what the content is*. It runs the layers — all three,
on every call, with no mode, config or source property reducing the count —
merges their opinions into one risk level, and reports which layer, if any,
would refuse the content and which could not finish. It does not raise, and
it does not choose policy.

`modes.py` decides *what to do about it*, for the tools and the gateway
alike: block refuses, flag delivers with the verdict, redact extracts. The
mode decides delivery, never detection.

## Why it lives at package root

`tools/` and `gateway/` both need it. Importing `gateway.defense` from `tools/`
would execute `gateway/__init__`, which pulls in the app, router, and session
registry — heavy, and one refactor away from an import cycle. The Profile type
is imported under TYPE_CHECKING only, so this module depends on nothing but
the layers themselves.

    codebase that knew how to defend a structured payload. Tool responses carry
    a `structuredContent` dict on exactly the same terms, so this belongs in
    the pipeline rather than in one endpoint.

    Since L1 stopped modifying content there is no rebuild at all — the input
    object is returned as-is. What this produces is the accounting: merged
    stats across every leaf, the original leaf texts (``texts``) joined for
    L3, and the normalized leaf texts (``l2_inputs``) joined for L2. Leaves
    are inspected individually but judged as ONE document — a classifier shown
    one field at a time cannot see an instruction split across two of them.

    The traversal itself lives in ``jsonwalk.iter_leaves``. It used to be
    written out here as well, a second hand-maintained copy of the same walk;
    ``tests/test_full_is_defend_json.py`` proved the two agreed, which is what
    made it safe to keep one. That walk is iterative on purpose — a 4KB
    "[[[[..." depth bomb against a recursive one is an attacker-triggerable
    RecursionError, and an exception mid-scan is a fail-open.
