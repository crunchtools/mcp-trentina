"""Where a call went, for the audit row (#266).

The audit said which profile called which tool and how it ended, never where
the call was pointed. After an incident that left 17,600 actions to
reconstruct, "which hosts did it fetch, who did it message" was the one
question the database could not answer.

Three kinds, each stored beside the call in ``gateway_calls``:

- ``fetch``: the URL's host, then ``#`` and ``sha256[:16]`` of the whole URL.
  The host is what fan-out counts; the hash tells two URLs on one host apart
  without keeping a path or query that may carry a token.
- ``search``: ``q#`` and ``sha256[:16]`` of the query. Repeats are visible,
  the words are not.
- ``param``: for a proxied tool its backend declares in ``destination_params``,
  that argument's value — the channel, recipient, repo or queue — truncated.

The value is caller-chosen, so it lives in the audit database only, which no
tool reads raw. It never goes to the log (#262), and ``quarantine_stats``
shows it only to the agent that chose it; the operator gets its fingerprint.
