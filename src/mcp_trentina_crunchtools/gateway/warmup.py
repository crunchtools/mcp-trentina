"""Boot warm-up: judge every profile's tool descriptions before anyone asks (#216).

On a cold perimeter store the first ``tools/list`` judges every tool
description through all three layers, and a client times out waiting for it
(#104). The warm-up starts that work as soon as the event loop serves,
through the same single-flight build a client's ``tools/list`` uses
(``router.ensure_profile_build``), so a client connecting mid-warm-up joins
the work in flight instead of starting its own.

It runs as background L3 work: user-facing scans are granted limiter slots
first, and it may wait out a provider's throttling far longer than a user
call would, because nobody is waiting on it.
