"""Matrix Client-Server API reverse proxy — authenticated, scanned.

Forwards requests from ``/matrix/{token}/{path}`` to the configured Matrix
homeserver. Agents on the internal network point their homeserver URL at
``http://trentina:PORT/matrix/<token>`` instead of directly at matrix.org;
the Matrix client's own path segments (``_matrix/client/...``) follow the
prefix untouched, so the client needs no changes beyond the URL.

**Auth.** The token is the gateway's, not Matrix's: it resolves to a
profile (constant-time compare, mirroring the alert ingress) and requests
with no valid token get 401. Before this existed the proxy was an open
relay — anything that could reach the port could proxy to the homeserver
through Trentina, unauthenticated and unattributed. Matrix's OWN auth (the
access token in the Authorization header) still passes through untouched;
this proxy never injects or reads Matrix credentials.

**Scanning.** Message-bearing responses — ``/sync`` and room
``/messages`` — are long-poll JSON, so they are buffered whole and judged
by the shared pipeline (latency is noise against a 120s poll). Annotate
mode: the body forwards byte-identical, a flagged response gains a root
``_trentina_warning`` key (Matrix clients ignore unknown root keys), and
the flag is recorded as ``source_type="matrix_sync"``. Endpoints that
carry no room content stream through untouched.

**Unjudged responses (#227).** A response no layer finished judging — over
the admission cap, past the deadline, a required layer absent — is not a
flagged one, and does not forward unchanged: under ``unjudged: withhold``
(the default) every room event keeps its ID, sender and place, and its
content becomes a notice. The client stays in sync, ``next_batch`` is
honoured, and the agent reads nothing unjudged. Judging runs with
``stop_on_partial``, so an over-cap response costs a token count, not ~74
L2 windows.

**E2EE honesty.** For encrypted rooms this proxy sees ciphertext;
plaintext materializes inside the agent's Matrix client, past the
perimeter. Scanning covers unencrypted rooms only, and no gateway can
claim otherwise.

There was no deadline here at all. ``defend_json`` runs L2 (ONNX, hundreds of
ms per window) and may call L3 (a network round-trip to a third-party LLM),
and a Matrix ``/sync`` sits on the client's critical path — OpenClaw gives a
channel 30 seconds to become ready and starts over if it does not. A slow or
hanging judge therefore did not degrade Matrix, it stopped it.

Twenty seconds is chosen against that 30 s budget: long enough that a healthy
scan never trips it, short enough to leave the client room to finish. On
expiry the body forwards — fail open on the request path, as everything else
here does — but it forwards WITH a warning, because an unscanned response must
