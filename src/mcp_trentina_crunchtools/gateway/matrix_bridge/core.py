"""One profile's bridge, gateway side: judge every event, then carry it across.

Inbound, the bridge process hands over one decrypted event at a time. The
gateway runs it through L1 ∥ L2 → L3 (``defend_json``), and only then writes
it into the agent's Conduit as the sender's stand-in — or, under ``block``,
writes a withheld notice in its place. What was judged is what is delivered:
the content, the sender's display name, and the room's name and topic.

Outbound, Conduit pushes the agent's own events to the appservice. Each is
judged the same way before the bridge encrypts and sends it upstream; a
refused one never leaves, and the agent is told so in its room.

Echo suppression is structural. Only events whose sender is the agent's local
user go outbound, so the stand-ins and the bot this module writes as never
loop back; and the bridge process drops upstream events whose sender is its
own account, which is where the agent's replies reappear.

No agent-to-agent channel (#264). Every other bridged profile's public user
is known here and nowhere else, so this is where the rule lives: an event from
one is dropped, a room announced with one in it is refused (the bridge leaves
it), and nothing is relayed into a room unless its members were reported and
none of them is another agent. That holds for a room an allowed inviter
opened too: the inviter rule is the bridge's, this one is the gateway's.
