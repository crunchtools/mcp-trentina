"""The per-call mode, inserted into every tool the gateway serves (#193).

A profile's `defense.modes` is the policy: which of block, flag and redact its
agent may choose, on every tool of every backend. The gateway puts that choice
where the agent can make it, and nowhere else:

* **tools/list** — `strip_params` removes any `trentina_*` property a backend
  declared (ours included) BEFORE the perimeter scan. Since 0.39.0 nothing is
  inserted after it unless the profile sets `declare_modes`: every tool
  accepts `trentina_mode`, and even the bare enum on every tool cost a
  376-tool profile ~39 KB a session.
* **initialize** — `instructions` explains the modes ONCE per profile (#198),
  including the extraction form `{"redact": "<question>"}` (0.39.0), which
  replaced a separate `trentina_prompt`.
* **tools/call** — `resolve_call` pops the arguments, resolves an omitted mode
  to the default, and only then checks the policy. Checking first would let an
  omitted mode skip the check, the way a parameter guard skips an argument
  that is absent. Remote backends never see either argument.

`Backend.modes` and a `parameter_guards` entry on `trentina_mode` narrow the
policy for one backend or one tool. Neither is needed for the base policy.

`trentina_preprocess` (#183; a switch since 0.38.0) rides the same three
steps. Its policy is the resolved `preprocess` config: `processors` is what
minifying runs, `required` the floor the switch cannot remove. Every tool
accepts it and `instructions` explains it once; a tool's schema declares it
only when its config says `selectable`, because a declaration on every tool
cost a 376-tool profile ~15 KB for a switch the instructions already describe.
