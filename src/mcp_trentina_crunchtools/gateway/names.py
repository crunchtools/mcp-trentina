"""Short tool names: the simplest name that says what a tool does (0.38.0).

Until 0.38.0 every tool was served as ``<backend>__<tool>``: ``jira__jira_search``,
``cloudflare__list_zones_tool``, ``wp-blog__wordpress_get_post``. The
backend is already in the client's own prefix (``mcp__trentina__``), the
tool repeats it, and ``_tool`` says nothing. On a 376-tool profile the names were 10 KB
before a client prefixed them.

The rule, applied without a model:

1. Drop a trailing ``_tool``.
2. Drop the longest run of leading words that EVERY tool of that backend
   shares (``jira_``, ``wordpress_``, ``gemini_``), and a leading word that
   is the backend's own name, unless one word would be all that is left:
   ``memory_store`` stays, ``jira_get_issue`` becomes ``get_issue``.
3. Where two backends' tools still end up with the same name, prefix each
   with its backend's tag: ``Backend.name_tag``, else the backend name.
   ``work_send_gmail_message`` and ``home_send_gmail_message``, never
   ``send_gmail_message1``, because a number cannot tell an agent which
   account it is about to send from.

A name, once issued to a profile, is never reassigned (``database.tool_names``).
A backend added later cannot rename a tool an agent already knows: the
newcomer takes the tag. Everything behind the edge — allowlists, guards,
``preprocess_tools``, the verdict cache, the audit log — keeps using the real
``(backend, tool)``; only ``tools/list`` and ``tools/call`` see short names.
