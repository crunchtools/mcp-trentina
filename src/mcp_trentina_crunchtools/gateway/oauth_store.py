"""Lifetimes and disk hygiene for the OAuth proxy's on-disk store.

FastMCP's ``OAuthProxy`` keeps its clients, transactions, CSRF tokens, codes
and token metadata in one ``FileTreeStore`` — a file per key. Two properties of
that store are fine on their own and bad together:

- a record written with **no TTL lives forever**, and a DCR registration was
  written that way;
- an **expired record is only unlinked when something reads its key**, and an
  abandoned OAuth flow is by definition never read again.

So a gateway accumulated one permanent file per registration and one immortal
file per abandoned flow, at zero cost to whoever caused it. See #156.

This module supplies the two halves of the answer.

**Lifetimes.** A new registration is provisional and short-lived — an hour is
generous, since a real client registers and logs in within seconds. Completing
a token exchange promotes it to long-lived, and every later exchange re-stamps
it. Nothing tracks "last used" separately: re-putting the record with a fresh
TTL *is* the stamp, which is why there is no second bookkeeping store to get
out of step with the first.

**Sweeping.** ``cull()`` walks the store and unlinks what has expired. It is
driven from the first request the OAuth routes serve and then on an interval,
rather than from a lifespan hook, because records only accumulate as a
consequence of traffic: a gateway serving none has nothing to sweep, and one
serving traffic sweeps from the moment it does.
