"""The one registry: a configured name becomes a pre-processor.

There is one driver role. Everything a profile can name in `processors:`
resolves here, and nowhere else answers the question "the profile asked for X
on the Y channel; give me it, or fail the load".

There were two registries until #167, one per role, each with its own parity
test and only one of them with a channel lock. That was the cost of the split:
the lock was written once, in the half nobody copied it out of, so a
pre-processor could be named on any channel and nothing checked. Different
input shapes do not need different wiring.

**Channel locking.** A processor declares the ingresses it understands and
selecting one elsewhere is a ``ProfileConfigError`` at config load, not a
runtime surprise. ``loader._check_drivers`` builds every driver a profile
names at startup, which is what makes "at load" true rather than "on the first
request that happens to use it". The Matrix case is the loud one — a Matrix
processor pointed at alert-ingress JSON would find no Matrix event shape, fall
through to generic rules, and produce a perimeter nobody had checked against
that payload. The text case is quiet and just as wrong: a reducer tuned for
one shape, pointed at another, declines forever and looks like it is working.

**Kind locking.** A channel hands its processors either a string or a parsed
document, never both. Refusing the mismatch here turns what would be an
AttributeError deep inside a request into a refused config.

**Parity.** The table is declared twice — once here, once as a ``Literal`` in
``profile.py`` that makes pydantic reject an unknown name at YAML load. A
single parity test (``tests/test_gateway_drivers.py``) keeps them in step. A
driver registered but not in the Literal is dead on arrival: wired in, passing
its own tests, and nameable by no profile.
