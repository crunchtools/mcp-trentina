"""Run a document processor, report what it read, and fail open to reading more.

``gateway/drivers.py`` turns a configured name into a processor. This is the
call site: run it, degrade safely if it raises, and turn the coverage
accounting into the fields an operator reads.

This file held a second driver registry until #167, alongside a
mirror of the pre-processor one. Two registries for two roles is how the
pre-processor table ended up with no channel lock at all — the lock was
written once, in the half nobody copied it out of. Both tables now live in
``drivers.py``, and there is one role.
