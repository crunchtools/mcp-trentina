    ``/register`` is unauthenticated by design, and given no list FastMCP

    authorization-code theft path behind one consent click: register a client

    ``/authorize`` link, and their code arrives at you carrying their verified
    identity — which satisfies ``allowed_emails``, because it really is them.

    Why gemini.google.com is not in the defaults
    --------------------------------------------
    Its callback is per-user:
    ``oauth-redirect.googleusercontent.com/r/user_bound_custom-mcp-<id>-<host>``.
    Shipping it would mean shipping a prefix wildcard, and every Google user —
    including an attacker — has a callback under that prefix. The operator's own

            OAuthProxy deliberately downgrades every DCR registration to a
            public client: it discards the secret the SDK minted and rewrites
            `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `"none"`, on the reasoning that the
            proxy holds the upstream credentials and never checks a downstream
            one. That reasoning stops holding the moment a client *requires* a
            confidential registration.

            gemini.google.com Custom Apps is such a client. Google Account
            Linking authenticates at the token endpoint with a client id AND
            secret, so a registration answered with "you are public, here is no
            secret" does not satisfy what it asked for. It reports "automatic
            registration failed" and stops — which is why nothing was ever
            logged here: the flow ended before a single POST was sent.

            So the SDK's secret is put back for a `client_secret_post`
            registration, and the stored record carries it, which is what makes
            the SDK's ClientAuthenticator enforce it at `/token` rather than
            merely advertise it. A client that registered `"none"` is left
            exactly as OAuthProxy made it, so Claude Code and every other public
            DCR client keeps the registration it already has.

            Note this is opt-OUT, not opt-in: the SDK defaults an omitted
            `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `client_secret_post`, so a client
            that says nothing gets a secret and must then present it. That
            default is the MCP SDK's own choice
            (`mcp/server/auth/handlers/register.py`), NOT the RFC's — RFC 7591
            §2 defaults the field to `client_secret_basic`. The 0.15.0 notes
            and an earlier version of this docstring both called it "RFC 7591's
            own default", which sent a reader to the RFC to find a sentence
            that is not there. The Python MCP client and FastMCP's client both
            send `"none"` explicitly, which is why the SDK default does not
            surprise them.

            Every registration is stored PROVISIONALLY — see
            `gateway/oauth_store.py`. It lives an hour unless a token exchange
            promotes it, which is what stops the ordinary connect/reconnect
            cycle from littering the store with permanent records nobody
            reads again. See #156.

            Only `client_secret_post` is honoured. The SDK reads `client_id`
            from the form body before it looks at the Authorization header, so
            `client_secret_basic` would reject the RFC 6749 §2.3.1 form that
            omits it — advertising a method that half works is worse than not
            offering it. See RT #1502.

            OAuthProxy hardcodes `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` to
            `["none"]` because it never enforces a downstream client secret.
            Both a provisioned client and, since RT #1502, a DCR client that
            registered confidentially do have one enforced by the SDK's
            ClientAuthenticator (hmac-compared, expiry-checked), so
            `client_secret_post` is true rather than decorative.

            It is advertised unconditionally, not only when a provisioned client
            exists: a client reads this document BEFORE it registers, and uses it
            to decide whether this server can issue it the confidential
            registration it needs. Advertising only after the fact would leave
            that client with nothing to go on.

            The metadata route is rebuilt deep inside the base `get_routes`, so
            the advertised document is patched on the way out instead of
            reimplementing that construction. See CHANGELOG 0.9.0, RT #1502.
