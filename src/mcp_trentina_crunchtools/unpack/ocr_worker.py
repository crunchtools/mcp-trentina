"""Read the text drawn in images, as JSON, in a child process (#370).

Run by ``ocr.read_images`` and by nothing else:

    python -m mcp_trentina_crunchtools.unpack.ocr_worker < request.json

The request is ``{"images": [<base64>, ...], "seconds": <budget>}``; the
answer has one entry per image, ``{"text": [...], "faint": [...]}``, or null
for an image that could not be read or that the budget ran out before.
Like the PDF worker, this is a process so that it can be stopped: it
decodes hostile images with three native libraries and then holds most of
a gigabyte while the models run. It limits its own CPU and address space,
starts with no credential, and is killed at a deadline.

Each image is read twice. Once as it is, and once with its contrast
stretched, which turns near-white text on white into black on white. The
second pass recognizes only the boxes the first did not read. A line either
pass finds in a box with almost no contrast in the picture as it arrived is
``faint``: text a person looking at it would not see. Transparency is laid over
mid-grey first, so text drawn in white or in black on a clear background
shows either way.

This is an OCR-level guarantee, and it is stated as one (Known gaps):
print and screen text in the scripts the bundled PP-OCR models read.
Handwriting, stylised lettering, text rotated well off the horizontal and
an image built to fool a model are outside it.
