"""The perimeter's own store — what the defense pipeline CONCLUDED.

Separate from ``database.py`` on purpose, and the reason is worth stating
plainly because it is not a security boundary today.

``database.py`` holds dirty data: the blocklist, call audit, compressed
descriptions, and the tool lists backends handed us. This file holds the
opposite kind of fact — the verdict ``defend()`` reached about a piece of
content. Splitting them buys nothing on a single-uid deployment: both files
are owned by the process that reads them, and anyone who can rewrite one
can rewrite the other, the code, or the image. Anything stronger would
need the rows signed, not merely filed apart.

What the split buys is the OPTION. If these ever move to a real database,
two stores can have two owners, two grants, and two code paths; one table
next to the blocklist cannot be given any of that afterwards without
finding every caller that assumed a single connection. That is the whole
argument, and it is an argument about tomorrow.

What is here is a cache and only a cache. Losing this file costs one slow
restart and nothing else.

"3" (0.23.0): petit frames before it groups, so different bytes survive
reduction. "4" (0.31.0): L2 reads the arrived bytes plus L1's normalized copy,
L3 is briefed with L2's result, and warnings carry L3's finding types.
"5" (0.55.0): L3's caveat about L2 no longer quotes Prompt Guard 2's miss
rates (#350). "6" (0.56.0): L2 reads the arrived bytes once, never L1's copy,
and L3's briefing names L1's findings by type (#359). "7" (0.57.0): every
layer reads the delivery unpacked, base64 decoded and binary labelled (#367).
