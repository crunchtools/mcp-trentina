"""The internal tools' pre-processing: minify unless asked not to, before judging.

The gateway's ``transform_response`` never sees these tools — the router
skips it for internal backends, because they judge at their own ingress — so
the same decision has to happen here, on the producer path. It runs before
``judge_and_deliver`` and everything after judges and delivers its output:
what is scanned is what is delivered.

One failure rule, the same as the proxied path (0.38.0). The operator's
floor (``required``) FAILS CLOSED: a floor that breaks refuses the call,
because delivering something else in its place would be a silent
substitution. Minification FAILS OPEN: a minifier that breaks costs the
agent tokens, not content, so the unminified text is judged and delivered.

What conversion deleted reaches nobody, but a page that hid text from its
reader has shown its intent. So L1's hiding stage counts the ORIGINAL, the
way ``dir`` merges its shadow counts, and L3 is told how many elements went.
