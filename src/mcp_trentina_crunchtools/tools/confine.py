"""Where read_tool and dir_tool may look (#261).

Both tools take a path from the agent, and until #261 neither asked where it
pointed: ``read_tool /config/profiles.yaml`` delivered every profile's
topology and the credentials inside backend URLs. The rule here is default
deny behind a gateway:

- ``TRENTINA_READ_ROOTS`` lists the directories a path may resolve into.
  A live gateway with none configured refuses every path — production leaves
  it unset on purpose, since the gateway container has no agent workspace.
  A standalone server with none keeps its old reach: one operator, their
  own files.
- ``HARD_DENIED`` and Trentina's own state and config directories are
  refused even when a root would admit them. A root of ``/`` does not
  open ``/proc/self/environ``.

Checking a path and then opening it is a race: swap a component for a
symlink in between and the open lands somewhere the check never saw.
``open_confined`` closes it three ways. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses a symlink in
the final component; ``fstat`` must match the inode stat'd at check time;
and the kernel's own name for the opened descriptor is checked again, which
catches a swapped INTERMEDIATE directory that the other two follow.

Refusals carry a reason code and never the path (see ``FileReadError``).

Two more rules since #263 and #278:

- The denylist and roots are checked on the path as written, lexically
  normalized, BEFORE anything is resolved, and again on the resolved path.
  Resolving first answered ``not_found`` for a missing path and
  ``denied_path`` for an existing denied one: a file-existence oracle over
  the container, one bit per call.
- Behind a live gateway, ``not_found``, ``denied_path`` and
  ``outside_read_roots`` are one reason, ``not_found_or_denied``. A symlink
  inside a root that points somewhere denied still has to be resolved to be
  refused, and only the merge keeps that from telling a caller whether its
  target exists. Standalone keeps the three apart: one operator, their own
  files.

A refusal reaches the caller the way the egress guard's does (``refused``):
a ``BlockedSourceError`` with no alternatives, which the router audits as
``blocked_defense``. It was a ``FileReadError`` until #278, audited as
``backend_error``, which filed a hijacked agent's probing as breakage.
