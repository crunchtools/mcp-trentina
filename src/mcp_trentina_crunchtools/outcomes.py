"""Outcome taxonomy for gateway audit rows.

A single ``success`` boolean cannot describe what happened to a tool call, and
reading one as a health signal actively misleads. ``fetch_tool`` and
``read_tool`` in block mode fail closed by design: when the defense pipeline blocks content
the tool *raises*, which under a boolean schema is indistinguishable from the
backend being down. An operator reading "2 ok / 34 errors" concludes the tool
is broken when the truth may be that it blocked 34 hostile pages.

The taxonomy splits three questions that the boolean collapsed into one:

- Did the call return content?           -> ``OK``
- Did *policy* stop it?                  -> the ``blocked`` group
- Did something *break*?                 -> the ``failed`` group

Only the ``failed`` group belongs in a health signal. The ``blocked`` group is
the gateway working as designed, and its rate is a security metric, not an
error rate.
